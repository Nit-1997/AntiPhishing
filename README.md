# AntiPhishing
The aim of the project is to develop a safe browsing django web application that detects whether URL under browse is malicious or benign and then redirects the user accordingly. Here we have made an attempt to automate this task using Multilayer Perceptron Model with Backpropagation (using Gradient Descent ) as the learning algorithm for our network model.
